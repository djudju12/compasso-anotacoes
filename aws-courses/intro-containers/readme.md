* Describe the history, tech, and terminology behind containers:
   
   Container is a standardized unit os software designed to run quickly
   and reliably on any computing env that is running the containerization
   platform.
   Containers are a form of virtualization that is implemented at the 
   operating system level. Containers are lightweight, standalone packages
   that include everything that is needed to run an application.

* Differentiate containers from bare-metal servers and vms:

   Bare-metal you need to do everything in one server, that it, you have to
   share libraries and everything. You can use vms to isolate the components,
   but vms are heavy and you cant share if you needed. Containers arent heavy 
   and you have more flexiablity, allowing to spun up and down faster and share
   and do everything that vms cant. Containers are more portable to.

* Characteristics of microservices (they are good together):
 
  * Decentralized, evolutionary design
  * Smart endpoints, dumb pipes
  * Independent products, not projects
  * Designed for failure
  * Disposability
  * Development and production parity
