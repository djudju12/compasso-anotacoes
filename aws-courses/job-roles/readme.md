### AWS Cloud for Businesses 

**Traditional on-premises model:**

* Highly manual

* Expensive equipment

* Less than full capacity

**AWS Cloud:**

* Increased development speed

* Scalable 

What are the benefits of transitioning to the **AWS Clound** and what it means for on premises IT job roles?

There are three key aspects that you want to remember when migrating to the cloud:

* How AWS Cloud can free up teams to focus on **innovation**?

* How job roles change when migrating to AWS Cloud?

* How high-level jobs role will translate to the AWS Cloud?

**Traditional On-Premises job roles:**

* IT Solutions Architect

   Cretes high-level solutions for business apps, systems, portfolios, infrastrictures or an entire enterprise.
   They develop IT services and solutions for companies and orgs and often design and manage communictions, security, networking and storage

* Sysadmin

### Shared Responsibility Model 

Security and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. In the lesson, you will learn how to differentiate between customer and AAWS responsibilities

>**_Note:_** **AWS** is responsible for security _of_ the cloud and customer is responsible for security _in_ the cloud

This shared model relieve customers op burden. AWS operates, manages and controls the components from the gost op system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the service operates. The customer assumes responsibility and management of the guest OS, including updates and patches. The costumer also provides rules for firewall and other associated apps.

* System Admin

   The System Admin is responsible for overall performance of cloud systems. 
   A System Administrator in the cloud maintains data integrity by dploying, configuring, and monitoring hybrid and cloud solutions instead of infrasctructure performance and maintenance.

### Map On-Premises Job Roles to Job Roles in the Cloud

Take the Db Admin has an example. In On-premises this role is responsable to patche, update, procurement and other maintenance tasks. Moving to Cloud means that many of those tasks are now handled by AWS. This free up the role for look to optimize, explore innovations or investigate efficiency models. 

Cloud architect changes from issues with hardware, HVAC, or server upgrades, for example, to a focus on cloud tech. An example of Cloud Arc task might be to help a sys admin who needs help with an integration
